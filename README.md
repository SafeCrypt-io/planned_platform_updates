A list of additional features of SafeCrypt.io Platform for the upcoming updates

Smart trading notifications system

This feature allows users to create complex custom rules for the notifications to pop up. For instance, you want to exchange your Bitcoin to Ripple when relative "buy" price for Ripple reaches a certain value; as soon as the condition is met you will receive a notification:

- push notification for SafeCrypt.io mobile app;
- browser notification for the web version;
- text message or email notififaction as an option (set by user). 

It works as a substitute for placing orders on regular exchange platforms but with no requirement for the assets to be stored within the platform, thus lowering the risks for our traders to zero.


Customizable news or signals aggregator

This feature will be added by popular request. Traders will be able to set up a custom news feed to monitor all important events and trends signaling for potential changes in exchange rates of selected cryptocurrencies. 

The feed will allow our traders to stay tuned with crypto market's fluctuations and react promptly and accordingly. A list of available sources of news will include:

1. External websites;
2. Social networks (Twitter and Facebook);
3. Telegram channels;
4. Other sources (TBA).


Trading effectiveness analysis

An optional feature that will analyze the effectiveness of previous trading operations performed by user. It will act as user's personal stats log which can be analized to improve the user's trading methods and overall effectiveness. 

This feature will be customizable and is disabled (no logging) by default.

Cryptocurrency mixing functionality

The cryptocurrency mixing is a feature for traders seeking maximum anonymity. The feaure is already 
functional and includes: 

1. multi cryptocurrency mixing 
// traders will be able to exchange BTC to ETH, Ripple and other cryptocurrencies or ERC20 tokens in specified proportions;

2. delayed transactions
// time delays can be set up by a trader for each transaction (example: send 20% 
of my ETH in 50 minutes and the remaining 80% two hours later).

As we were advised by our legal consultants, the mixing functionality is a controversial topic and we will 
either create a mirror for the platform to make it available for our traders or will limit it to non-controversial functionalities.
SafeCrypt.io strives for maximum security and anonymity for crypto traders and we will put all reasonable efforts to have this feature available for everyone using SafeCrypt.io Cryptoexchange Platform.
